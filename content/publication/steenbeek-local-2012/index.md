abstract: While businesses may attract potential offenders and thus be conducive to
  disorder, the number of employees could offset this by exercising social control
  on offenders. This study uses data from different sources to test this expectation
  across 278 Dutch neighborhoods in the four largest cities of the Netherlands, using
  multivariate multilevel analysis to disentangle individual perception differences
  of disorder and neighborhood effects. Attention is paid to traditional explanations
  of disorder (i.e., poverty, residential mobility, and ethnic heterogeneity). Results
  show a positive relationship between business presence and neighborhood disorder.
  We do not find consistent results of the number of employees (i.e., bigger businesses
  are not always better or worse). Our research demonstrates that the presence of
  neighborhood businesses could rival the effects of social disorganization theory.
