abstract: This chapter investigates which agent-based mechanisms can or cannot generate
  near repeat patterns in serial victimizations of targets located in an abstract
  geographical space. Crime pattern theory suggests that offenders have an awareness
  space within which they will make a choice of targets. We propose dynamics on how
  awareness space changes over time, first as a function of previous awareness only
  (DAS-model), then as a function of previous target choices (CAS-model). Congruent
  with the near repeat literature, we look into the boost mechanism of temporary increase
  of attraction values of targets nearby previously victimized targets (CBA-model).
  We also look into cases where an offender victimizes more targets at nearly the
  same time (SPATE). We introduce a new yardstick, the Knox Sloping-down Index Î¾,
  to compare the strength of near repeat patterns. Results show that DAS and CAS are
  not able to generate near repeat patterns, but CBA and SPATE are, both alone and
  more so in combination.
