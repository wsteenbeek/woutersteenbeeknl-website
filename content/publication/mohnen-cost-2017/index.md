abstract: 'Objective: The introduction of bundled payment for diabetes care in the
  Netherlands led to the origination of care groups. This study explored to what extent
  variation in health care costs per patient can be attributed to the performance
  of care groups. Furthermore, the commonly applied simple mean aggregation was compared
  with the more advanced generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) to benchmark health
  care costs per patient between care groups. Data Source Dutch 2009 nationwide insurance
  claims data of diabetes type 2 patients (104,544 patients, 50 care groups).   Study
  Design: Both a simple mean aggregation and a GLMM approach was applied to rank care
  groups, using two different health care costs variables: total treatment health
  care costs and diabetes-specific specialist care costs per diabetes patient. Principal
  Findings Care groups varied slightly in the first and mainly in the second indicator.
  Care group variation was not explained by composition. Although the ranking methods
  were correlated, some care groupsâ€™ rank positions differed, with consequences on
  the top-10 and the low-10 positions.   Conclusions: Differences between care groups
  exist when an appropriate indicator and a sophisticated aggregation technique is
  used. Currently applied benchmarking may have unfair consequences for some care
  groups.'
