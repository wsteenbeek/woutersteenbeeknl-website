abstract: The present contribution is a space-time analysis of the public reaction
  to crime in the Netherlands based on the Dutch ‘Police Population Monitor’ (PPM)
  survey (PolitieMonitor Bevolking) between 1993 and 2001. The PPM is a large-scale
  biannual household survey covering every municipality in the Netherlands that includes
  a series of items on public attitudes on crime, fear of crime, physical and social
  disorder, as well as public satisfaction and confidence in the police. The current
  study uses the five PPM datasets of this period to perform geovisualization and
  spatio-temporal clus- tering analyses of Dutch municipalities. The objective of
  this contribution is to detect the spatio-temporal patterns in the PPM data in order
  to determine whether there are significant local differences in public reaction
  to crime and attitudes towards the police and whether there have been notice- able
  shifts in popular opinion over time.
