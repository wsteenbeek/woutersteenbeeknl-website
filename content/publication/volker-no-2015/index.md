abstract: A recent PNAS article (1) argues that success rates for attaining research
  grants are gender-biased. However, the overall gender effect borders on statistical
  significance, despite the large sample. Moreover, their conclusion could be a prime
  example of Simpson’s paradox (2, 3); if a higher percentage of women apply for grants
