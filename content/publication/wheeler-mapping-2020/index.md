abstract: We illustrate how a machine learning algorithm, Random Forests, can provide
  accurate long-term predictions of crime at micro places relative to other popular
  techniques. We also show how recent advances in model summaries can help to open
  the ‘black box’ of Random Forests, considerably improving their interpretability.
