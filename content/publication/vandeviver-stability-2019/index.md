abstract: 'Objectives: To examine the spatial concentration and spatial stability
  of residential burglary at micro places in the context of a substantial city-level
  burglary drop in Antwerp, Belgium.  Methods: 51,337 police recorded home burglary
  incidents for the period 2005–2016 are geo-referenced to 26,875 street segments.
  Longitudinal trends in spatial concentrations of burglary are considered using descriptive
  statistics, generalized Gini coefficients, and local Getis–Ord statistics. Andresen’s
  (Appl Geogr 29(3):333–345, 2009) non-parametric spatial point pattern test (SPPT)
  is used to identify spatial stability in burglary point patterns and evaluate the
  ubiquity of a city-level burglary drop across street segments. A longitudinal extension
  of the SPPT is implemented.  Results: Residential burglary is substantially concentrated
  in street segments. Burglary point patterns exhibit a moderate to high degree of
  spatial stability over time. Local analyses show that 91% of street segments with
  burglary experienced a net decrease in crime and under 1% of street segments with
  burglary experienced a net increase. Absolute spatial stability over time is found
  for just 1.43% of street segments with burglary and minor increases are consistently
  observed for as few as 11 street segments with burglary.  Conclusions: The citywide
  home burglary drop manifested itself uniformly across street segments with burglary
  and the majority of street segments that experienced burglary contributed relatively
  equally to the crime drop. In other words, we find no strong evidence that the city-level
  crime drop can be tied to substantial decreases in a few specific places, nor do
  we find that the reductions in burglary are spatially concentrated.'
