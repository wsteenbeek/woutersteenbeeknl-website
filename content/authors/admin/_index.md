I am a senior researcher at the Netherlands Institute for the Study of Crime and Law Enforcement, a research institute of the Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research.

Most of my work is on the 'geography of crime'. I describe spatial and temporal variations in crime, and explain these variations as a function of the characteristics of places and of how potential offenders, potential victims, informal and formal guardians use their spatial environment over daily and weekly time cycles.

I'm always up for collaboration. [Send me an email](mailto:wsteenbeek@nscr.nl) if you're interested!

Are you interested in situational and spatial criminology? Consider joining the [‘Space, Place, and Crime’ working group](http://www.space-place-crime.eu/) of the European Society of Criminology.
