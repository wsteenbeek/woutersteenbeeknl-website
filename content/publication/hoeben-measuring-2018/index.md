abstract: 'Objectives: The present study focuses on Systematic Social Observation
  (SSO) as a method to investigate physical and social disorder at different units
  of analysis. The study contributes to the aggregation bias debate and to the ‘social
  science of ecological assessment’ in two ways: first, by presenting a new model
  that directly controls for observer bias in ecological constructs and second, by
  attempting to identify systematic sources of bias in SSO that affect the valid and
  reliable measurement of physical and social disorder at both street segments and
  neighborhoods.  Methods: Data on physical disorder (e.g., litter, cigarette butts)
  and social disorder (e.g., loitering adults) from 1422 street segments in 253 different
  neighborhoods in a conurbation of the greater The Hague area (the Netherlands) are
  analyzed using cross-classified multilevel models.  Results: Neighborhood differences
  in disorder are overestimated when scholars fail to recognize the cross-classified
  data structure of an SSO study that is due to allocation of street segments to observers
  and neighborhoods. Not correcting for observer bias and observational conditions
  underestimates the disorder–crime association at street segment/grid cell level,
  but overestimates this association at the neighborhood level.  Conclusion: Findings
  indicate that SSO can be used for measuring disorder at both street segment level
  and neighborhood level. Future studies should pay attention to observer bias prior
  to their data collection by selecting a minimum number of observers, offering extensive
  training, and collecting information on the urban background of the observers.'
