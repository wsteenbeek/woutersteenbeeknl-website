abstract: 'Objectives: Introduce a systematic method to identify areas with similar
  levels of disorder (from serene, to “tipping,” to crime-ridden) which is crucial
  for a valid empirical test of Broken Windows Theory (BWT).  Methods: Systematic
  social observation data are used of almost 2,000 locations in the city of Amsterdam,
  the Netherlands. Spatially constrained hierarchical agglomerative clustering is
  used to aggregate individual observation locations to form homogeneous areas. Davies–Bouldin
  index and intraclass correlation coefficient are used to objectively identify the
  optimum number of clusters.  Results: The newly identified areas differ from administrative
  neighborhoods as well as hot spots of disorder. The regionalization method provides
  a tentative solution to both the “zonation” and “aggregation” problems of the modifiable
  areal unit problem liable to affect empirical studies of BWT.  Conclusions: Hot
  spot analysis fails to identify areas with moderate levels of disorder, which impedes
  testing the basic precept of BWT. Our results may partly explain why the evidence
  on the effectiveness of order maintenance policing remains inconclusive. We suggest
  that randomized controlled trials of order maintenance policing should be performed
  on these new areas rather than in hot spots of disorder.'
