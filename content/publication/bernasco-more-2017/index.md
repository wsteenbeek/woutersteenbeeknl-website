abstract: 'Objectives: The crime and place literature lacks a standard methodology
  for measuring and reporting crime concentration. We suggest that crime concentration
  be reported with the Lorenz curve and summarized with the Gini coefficient, and
  we propose generalized versions of the Lorenz curve and the Gini coefficient to
  correct for bias when crime data are sparse (i.e., fewer crimes than places).  Methods:
  The proposed generalizations are based on the principle that the observed crime
  concentration should not be compared with perfect equality, but with maximal equality
  given the data. The generalizations asymptotically approach the original Lorenz
  curve and the original Gini coefficient as the number of crimes approaches the number
  of spatial units.  Results: Using geocoded crime data on two types of crime in the
  city of The Hague, we show the differences between the original Lorenz curve and
  Gini coefficient and the generalized versions. We demonstrate that the generalizations
  provide a better representation of crime concentration in situations of sparse crime
  data, and that they improve comparisons of crime concentration if they are sparse.  Conclusions:
  Researchers are advised to use the generalized versions of the Lorenz curve and
  the Gini coefficient when reporting and summarizing crime concentration at places.
  When places outnumber crimes, the generalized versions better represent the underlying
  processes of crime concentration than the original versions. The generalized Lorenz
  curve, the Gini coefficient and its variance are easy to compute.'
