abstract: 'Objectives: To quantitatively test findings from offender-based literature—primarily
  consisting of small-sample interviews or experimental scenarios with convicted burglars—to
  investigate the extent to which the physical attributes of residential homes and
  their immediate surrounding area contribute to the risk of burglary.  Methods: Collecting
  fresh, micro-level data using Google Street View (GSV) as a tool of Systematic Social
  Observation (SSO), we utilise a case-control design to isolate property-level effects.
  Analysis is carried out using conditional logistic regression.  Results: The ease
  of escape from a property, the extent to which the dwelling is accessible, and the
  extent to which it is closed to surveillance from neighbours and passers-by are
  all positively related to burglary risk. There is no evidence that indications of
  resident wealth are related to the likelihood of victimisation, or that the effect
  of surveillability varies depending on the extent of collective efficacy in a neighbourhood.  Conclusions:
  Burglary target selection does not stop at the selection of a target neighbourhood,
  but certain characteristics of individual properties within the same neighbourhood
  are in turn indicative of burglary risk. Quantitative analyses partly support findings
  from the offender-based research on residential burglary. We encourage future research
  to consider using GSV as a method of collecting fresh data, with the broader aim
  of explaining criminal behaviour at micro-spatial scales.'
