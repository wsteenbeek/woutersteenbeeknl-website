abstract: By emphasising that businesses attract offenders or generate ‘eyes on the
  street’ discouraging potential offenders, previous studies have largely neglected
  the active role of local business owners. As neighbourhood business owners have
  both individual and professional local stakes, they may take responsibility for
  a place and its immediate surroundings. Using a dataset of 895 residents and 385
  entrepreneurs nested within 161 residential neighbourhoods, we show that local business
  owners are more willing to intervene in disorderly situations than unemployed residents.
  The findings suggest that this is caused by them having both higher expectations
  about intervention by others and greater belief in their own problem-solving capabilities.
  We speculate that although entrepreneurs only report higher willingness than unemployed
  residents but not employed residents, their presence may nevertheless influence
  neighbourhood order because they spend much time locally and thus have many opportunities
  to turn their willingness into action on behalf of the neighbourhood.
