abstract: Crime clusters in space, with several potential explanatory mechanisms for
  the phenomena proposed within the field of environmental criminology. Of these explanations,
  the concept of crime generators and crime attractors set out by Brantingham and
  Brantingham (1995) has garnered considerable research attention. Relatedly, the
  study of crime concentration has also found that boundary areas between spaces experience
  more crime events than internal zones, commonly referred to as edge effects. There
  is, however, a dearth of research exploring the relationship between crime generators,
  crime attractors and edge effects. In an attempt to explore this gap in knowledge,
  this chapter utilises agent-based models to test whether these theoretical concepts
  can be considered in conjunction, with the aim of exploring whether the mechanisms
  which underpin generators and attractors can also lead to the emergence of edge
  effects. Whilst results of this study suggests that they cannot, they do identify
  clear differences in the spatial distribution of crime both inside and outside these
  spaces. To that end, in our experiments simulated crime generators produced increases
  in crime around facilities which decay over distance and high levels of clustering
  within them, while conversely crime remains consistent outside simulated crime attractors
  with only the facility itself seeing increased offending. We discuss how these findings
  contribute to theory development, and how they may support empirical studies that
  seek to better understand the mechanisms that underlie real world concentrations
  of crime.
