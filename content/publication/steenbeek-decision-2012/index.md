abstract: Many organizations are currently deciding whether to insource or outsource
  their IS function or parts thereof, but are unsure as to what kind of organizational
  structure to arrange for sourcing and where to locate the sourced activities. To
  assist in this matter, several IT consultancy firms are providing sourcing consultancy
  to their clients, resulting in a large body of practical knowledge that is stored
  in the experience of consultants. Systematic scientific knowledge is largely based
  upon qualitative case studies. This chapter presents the results of a policy capturing
  study that attempts to quantify the sourcing advice practice. Twenty-nine management
  consultants with experience in sourcing advice were presented with examples of situations
  in which sourcing advice was to be given. Using Factor Analysis and Multilevel Regression
  the researchers obtained insight into how variables such as costs, flexibility,
  time-to-market, and quality influence decisions with regard to both sourcing location
  as well as sourcing relationship. The research method that was used proved to be
  helpful in the explicitation of knowledge of consultants but needs further refinement.
