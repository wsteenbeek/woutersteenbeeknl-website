abstract: The analysis of geographically referenced data, specifically point data,
  is predicated on the accurate geocoding of those data. Geocoding refers to the process
  in which geographically referenced data (addresses, for example) are placed on a
  map. This process may lead to issues with positional accuracy or the inability to
  geocode an address. In this paper, we conduct an international investigation into
  the impact of the (in)ability to geocode an address on the resulting spatial pattern.
  We use a variety of point data sets of crime events (varying numbers of events and
  types of crime), a variety of areal units of analysis (varying the number and size
  of areal units), from a variety of countries (varying underlying administrative
  systems), and a locally-based spatial point pattern test to find the levels of geocoding
  match rates to maintain the spatial patterns of the original data when addresses
  are missing at random. We find that the level of geocoding success depends on the
  number of points and the number of areal units under analysis, but generally show
  that the necessary levels of geocoding success are lower than found in previous
  research. This finding is consistent across different national contexts.
