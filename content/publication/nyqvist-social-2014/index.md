abstract: 'Background: Social capital can be conceptualised as an individual resource
  residing in relationships between individuals or as a collective resource produced
  through interactions in neighbourhoods, communities or societies. Previous studies
  suggest that social capital is, in general, good for health. However, there is a
  shortage of studies analysing the association between individual and collective
  social capital in relation to health amongst older people.  Purpose: The purpose
  of this study was to assess the relationship between municipal- and individual-level
  social capital and self-rated health amongst older people in Western Finland and
  Northern Sweden.  Method: Data were retrieved from a cross-sectional postal questionnaire
  survey conducted in 2010. The study included, in total, 6,838 people aged 65, 70,
  75 and 80 years living in the two Bothnia regions, Västerbotten, Sweden and Pohjanmaa,
  Finland. The association between social capital and self-rated health was tested
  through multi-level logistic regression analyses with ecometric tests. Social capital
  was measured by two survey items: interpersonal trust and social participation.  Results:
  Individual-level social capital including social participation and trust was significantly
  associated with self-rated health. A negative association was found between municipal-level
  trust and health. However, almost all variation in self-rated health resided on
  the individual level.  Conclusions: We conclude that contextual-level social capital
  on a municipal level is less important for understanding the influence of social
  capital on health in the Bothnia region of Finland and Sweden. On the other hand,
  our study shows that individual-level social participation and trust have a positive
  and significant association with self-rated health. We suggest that other ways of
  defining social capital at the collective level, such as the inclusion of neighbourhood
  social capital, could be one direction for future research.'
