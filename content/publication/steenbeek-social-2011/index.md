abstract: From 2000 onwards Dutch governments have tried to improve the general 'livability'
  of neighborhoods, of which troublesome and potentially threatening social conditions
  (social disorder) and physical conditions (physical disorder) are one part. A major
  focus in these plans for improvement is the juxtaposition of 'living' and 'working'
  in the same neighborhood.   The presence of firms and local business ownership is
  thought to improve the neighborhood. Evidence for this idea is, however, hard to
  find. Business presence may lead to a regular flow of people on the street, thereby
  stimulating normal use and providing 'eyes on the street'. In contrast, empirical
  studies often find that business presence is related to more social and physical
  disorder rather than less disorder. Moreover, there is almost no research on individual
  actions by local entrepreneurs to make the neighborhood safer or cleaner.   This
  dissertation, a collection of five research papers, addresses these issues. It investigates
  the effect of neighborhood community characteristics and the effect of businesses
  on a neighborhoodâ€™s social and physical disorder. Complementary arguments from social
  disorganization theory and routine activity theory are combined to derive hypotheses
  on the effect of business presence and the actions by local business owners on the
  level of social and physical disorder. A combination of datasets and different statistical
  analyses (structural equation modeling, hierarchical linear analyses) are used to
  answer the research questions.   Most importantly, this study finds that (a) the
  presence of businesses is an important predictor of disorder, rivaling traditional
  explanations (e.g., population turnover); (b) disorder is not only caused by, but
  also drives population turnover and weakening of social control; (c) local entrepreneurs
  only differ from (unemployed) residents with regard to their willingness to intervene
  in disorderly situations
