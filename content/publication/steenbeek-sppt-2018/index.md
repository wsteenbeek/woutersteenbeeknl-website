abstract: sppt is an R package that implements several Spatial Point Pattern Tests.
  The first version of the package started with Martin Andresenâ€™s original Spatial
  Point Pattern Test, but several other functions have been implemented since.  The
  tests in this package measure the degree of similarity at the local level between
  two spatial point patterns and is an area-based test. They are not used for the
  purpose of testing point patterns with the null hypotheses of random, uniform, or
  clustered distributions, but may be used to compare a particular point pattern with
  these distributions. One advantage of the tests is that they can be performed for
  a number of different area boundaries using the same original point datasets.
