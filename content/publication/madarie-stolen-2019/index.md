abstract: Account hijacking, i.e. illegitimately accessing someone elseâ€™s personal
  online account, is on the rise and affects not only financial accounts, but the
  full spectrum of online accounts. To gain more insight in the illicit act of online
  dissemination of stolen account credentials, we systematically examined how such
  credentials were offered on three different types of online platforms where stolen
  credentials were disseminated and how offers varied by platform. We used web scrapes
  of these platforms for our comparative analyses. Our results demonstrate variation
  by platform in the type of information on accounts and account holders offered,
  the average asking price for credentials, and rules and services following a transaction.
  We conclude with policy implications and suggestions for future research based on
  the criminal event perspective.
