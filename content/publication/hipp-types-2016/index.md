abstract: Using a longitudinal data set of 317 neighborhoods from 1996 to 2002 in
  Utrecht, The Netherlands, this study tests whether types of crime differentially
  impact (a) the mechanisms of social disorganization theory and (b) residents’ mobility
  behavior and attitudes toward the neighborhood. Neighborhoods with more cohesion
  have less violence 2 years later. Also, neighborhoods perceiving more violence experience
  lower levels of cohesion 2 years later. Higher levels of perceived violence were
  most important for explaining who moves out of the neighborhood, as such neighborhoods
  had more non-Whites and more lower income households at the next time point. Burglaries
  (a crime that occurs in private space) appear to increase residents’ sense of feeling
  responsibility for the neighborhood.
