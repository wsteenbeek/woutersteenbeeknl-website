abstract: Social disorganization theory holds that neighborhoods with greater residential
  stability, higher socioeconomic status, and more ethnic homogeneity experience less
  disorder because these neighborhoods have higher social cohesion and exercise more
  social control. Recent extensions of the theory argue that disorder in turn affects
  these structural characteristics and mechanisms. Using a data set on 74 neighborhoods
  in the city of Utrecht in the Netherlands spanning 10 years, we tested the extended
  theory, which to date only a few studies have been able to do because of the unavailability
  of neighborhood-level longitudinal data. We also improve on previous studies by
  distinguishing between the potential for social control (feelings of responsibility)
  and the actual social control behavior. Cross-sectional analyses replicate earlier
  findings, but the results of longitudinal cross-lagged models suggest that disorder
  has large consequences for subsequent levels of social control and residential instability,
  thus leading to more disorder. This is in contrast to most previous studies, which
  assume disorder to be more a consequence than a cause. This study underlines the
  importance of longitudinal data, allowing for simultaneously testing the causes
  and consequences of disorder, as well as the importance of breaking down social
  control into the two dimensions of the potential for social control and the actual
  social control behavior.
